# Ontario Covid 19 Outbreak

This project was made with the intention of seeing and taking a look closely to what was happening with the cases for Covid-19 in the Ontario area. What Public Healt Units (PHU) were the most affected and with more outbreaks. Also it was included the different groups and subgroups that are mentioned in the dataset as an approach to be able to see what categories fall into the most affected.

Python was chose as the technology to be used in order to manipulate and visualize the information in a proper manner with all the packages and libraries necessaries for this project.

To run the project is only necessary to download the file attached due to the datasets are loaded from the website directly.

Feel free to use this project as an example of how the outbreak hit Toronto from 2019 to 2022.
